# Robotic Calculations and Inference Agent

> Data Science Experience is now Watson Studio. Although some images in this code pattern may show the service as Data Science Experience, the steps and processes will still work.

> Watson Conversation is now Watson Assistant. Although some images in this code pattern may show the service as Watson Conversation, the steps and processes will still work.

There is a technological revolution taking place in the service industry with the introduction of Robots. The Robots are powered by artifical intelligence and are able to perform the roles of a waiter, customer relationship executive, cognitive assistant etc. The capabilities of the robot can be enhanced exponentially by integrating with cloud capabilities. 

This code pattern demonstrates a scenario where the robot can answer queries on financial data by integrating with IBM Watson Assistant service and IBM Watson Studio. We will take you through the end to end flow of steps in building an interactive interface between [NAO](https://www.ald.softbankrobotics.com/en/robots/nao/find-out-more-about-nao) Robot, Watson Assistant API & Watson Studio. 

When the reader has completed this code pattern, they will understand how to:

* Establish the communication between NAO Robot and IBM Watson Studio with Watson Assistant.
* Create the Watson Assistant chat bot application.
* Perform statistical analysis on a financial dataset using Jupitor (Python) Notebook on IBM Watson Studio.

The intended audience for this code pattern are developers who want to develop a complete analytics solution on Watson Studio with a custom web user interface.

1. The user asks the questions on the dataset to the NAO Robot.
2. The NAO Robot will convert the speech to text, and will send the text to Node-RED Flow for further processing on the cloud. The results from the processing on the cloud is returned to the NAO Robot through the Node-RED flow.
3. Node-RED flow sends the converted text to the Watson Assistant API. 
4. The Watson Assistant API takes the text input. The text is analyzed to determine the intent based on the training provided.
5. The context and state of the conversation is saved to the Cloudant DB to track the conversation flow of the user.
6. The dataset for analysis is stored in the Object storage.
7. Data file is taken as input in csv format.
8. The Jupyter notebook receives the Watson Assistant Service API output from Node-RED using Web Sockets. The notebook processes the data based on the question and generates insights. The insights are sent back to the Node-RED flow using Web Socket.
9. The Jupyter notebook is powered by Spark.
10. The Node-RED flow sends the insights to NAO Robot.

## 11. Run the notebook

When a notebook is executed, what is actually happening is that each code cell in
the notebook is executed, in order, from top to bottom.

Each code cell is selectable and is preceded by a tag in the left margin. The tag
format is `In [x]:`. Depending on the state of the notebook, the `x` can be:

* A blank, this indicates that the cell has never been executed.
* A number, this number represents the relative order this code step was executed.
* A `*`, this indicates that the cell is currently executing.

There are several ways to execute the code cells in your notebook:

* One cell at a time.
  * Select the cell, and then press the `Play` button in the toolbar.
* Batch mode, in sequential order.
  * From the `Cell` menu bar, there are several options available. For example, you
    can `Run All` cells in your notebook, or you can `Run All Below`, that will
    start executing from the first cell under the currently selected cell, and then
    continue executing all cells that follow.
